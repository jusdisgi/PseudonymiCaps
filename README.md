# PseudonymiCaps

## Keycaps originally by Pseudoku, with additions by zzeneg and others before me.

The original version of these caps was created by Pseudoku, proprietor of [Asymplex](http://asymplex.xyz/). The original repository is still available [here](https://github.com/pseudoku/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles) and there is a wonderful writeup by the creator at [KBD News](https://kbd.news/On-the-DES-keycap-profile-2229.html).

##TL;DR 

Clone the repo and use OpenSCAD to open the [keycap file](https://github.com/jusdisgi/PseudonymiCaps/blob/main/PG1316S_DES_17x17.scad), then edit the parameters near the top to generate a keycap. Export to .stl or whatever else.

No just a bit of backstory: Pseudoku's repo has been forked numerous times and has a long history. I [forked](https://github.com/jusdisgi/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles) zzeneg's [fork](https://github.com/zzeneg/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles) in order to adapt some of the profiles to the new Kailh PG1316S switch; I quickly discovered the repo is impractically large, and a good portion of that is because the .git directory has grown to over 1.5GB. Most of the rest was .stl exports.

So I created a new repo with only the files necessary to create the keycaps. Any STLs I make available will be elsewhere (and I will put a link here).

As of this very first commit, the only things here are my new PG1316S versions of DES (though it will also generate chocs with the right parameters). I will be adding more models as I clean them up and test them.

If you're familiar with zzeneg's Low-profile Choc DES, these are the same except 0.5mm taller...zzeneg's were so low the PG1316S mounting slot wouldn't fit. A bit ironic that this ultra-low-profile switch needs higher-profile keycaps, but such is life.

The rest of this is straight from the original Pseudoku repo's readme:
