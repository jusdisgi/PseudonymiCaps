# PseudonymiCaps

## Keycaps originally by Pseudoku, with additions by zzeneg and others before me.

The original version of these caps was created by Pseudoku, proprietor of [Asymplex](http://asymplex.xyz/). The original repository is still available [here](https://github.com/pseudoku/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles) and there is a wonderful writeup by the creator at [KBD News](https://kbd.news/On-the-DES-keycap-profile-2229.html).

That repo has been forked numerous times and has a long history. I [forked](https://github.com/jusdisgi/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles) zzeneg's [fork](https://github.com/zzeneg/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles) in order to adapt some of the profiles to the new Kailh PG1316S switch; I quickly discovered the repo is impractically large, and a good portion of that is because the .git directory has grown to over 1.5GB.

So I decided to create a new repo without all that history and with only the files necessary to create the keycaps. Notably this repo does not and will not contain any .stl renderings of the caps. I may create some mesh sets of them in the future, but if I do they will be in a separate repo to keep this one clean.

As of this very first commit, the only things here are my new PG1316S versions of DES. I will be adding the rest of the models as I clean them up and test them.

If you're familiar with zzeneg's Low-profile Choc DES, these are the same except 0.5mm taller...zzeneg's were so low the PG1316S mounting slot wouldn't fit. A bit ironic that this ultra-low-profile switch needs higher-profile keycaps, but such is life.

The rest of this is straight from the original Pseudoku repo's readme:
